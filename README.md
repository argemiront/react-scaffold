# React Basic Scaffold Code

This is not meant to be used in production, but for quick tests and study for whom is starting on React and doesn't want to use create-react-app.

As this is a pretty basic tool it has only react compiled with webpack and some scripts to help you starting. This project will have other branches with more complex solutions, as Express, redux, server-side rendering, etc.
